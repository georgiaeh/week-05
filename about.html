    <h1>About Fennec Foxes</h1>
    <h2> Dens</h2>
    <p>A fennec fox digs its den in sand, either in open areas or places sheltered by plants with stable sand dunes. In compacted soils, dens are up to 120 m2 (1,300 sq ft) large, with up to 15 different entrances. In some cases, different families interconnect their dens, or locate them close together. In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber</p>

    <h2>Hunting and Diet</h2>
    <p>The fennec fox is an omnivore, feeding on small rodents, lizards, geckos, skinks, small birds and their eggs, fruits and also some tubers. It relies on the moisture content of prey, but drinks water when available. It hunts alone and digs in the sand for small vertebrates and insects. Some individuals were observed to bury prey for later consumption and searching for food in the vicinity of human settlements.<br>In the Algerian Sahara, 114 scat samples were collected that contained more than 400 insects, plant fragments and date palm Phoenix dactylifera fruits, remains of birds, mammals, squamata and insects.</p>

    <h2>Predators</h2>
    <p>African horned owl species likely prey on fennec fox pups. Anecdotal reports exist about caracals, jackals, striped hyenas also preying on the fennec fox. But according to nomads, the fennec fox is fast and changes directions so that even their Salukis are hardly able to capture it.</p>
